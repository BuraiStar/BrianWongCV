        <h2><span class = "nameFont">About Me</span></h2>
        <p><span class = "textFont"> Hello to whom is reading this, my name is Brian Wong Wei Wen, born in January 1994. Recently after Covid, I have been meaning to explore the world around me, and try new things. One of
            the main things that I was looking forward to learn is how to become a backend developer / fullstack developer, going to the gym, and learning how to cook.</span></p>
        <h2><span class = "nameFont">My Career Experiences</span></h2>
            <p><span class = "textFont"> I am a Senior Front-End Programmer for about 8 years, with many skills and talents learnt from across different companies.
            The most notable currently is TypeScript on an engine for Cocos where I helped develop a skeleton frame for slotgames for the brands that I worked for called 
            <a href="https://www.cuci22.com/">Live22</a>, 
            <a href="https://www.epicwin.app/">EpicWin</a>, and 
            <a href="https://www.uuslot88.com/#home">UUSlots</a>. Currently the games revenue generated by these games grossed around 100 million RM(Ringgit Malaysia) or about 25++ million $.
            Other projects that I had worked on was an app called TheNux on the IoS store, where it had to deal with cryptocurrency exchanges between crypto wallets and creation of such wallets.</span>
