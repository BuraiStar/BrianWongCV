        <h2><span class = "nameFont">About My Career</span></h2>
        <h3><span class = "companyNameFont">TTwoWeb Sdn. Bhd.</span></h3>
		<h4 style="color:white;">January 2020 - March 2021 (Junior Front-End Programmer)</span></h4>
            <p><span class = "textFont">TTwoWeb Sdn. Bhd. is the first company that I joined that isn't video game related. The company produced an app called the Nux, a crypto personalized wallet
                for quick and easy exchange between other wallets with major crypto currency, or meme/personalized cryptocurrency such as Dogecoin for both Android and IOS. I was tasked with creating the app in IOS,
                having to deal with communications between serverside and cryptoside for Crypto Hasing for Front-End, fixing and updating the app based on user experience, and user needs for the app.
                <br><br>
                The major coding language that I had to use is C++ and Swift for the app creation. 
            </span></p>
        <h3><span class = "companyNameFont">ProLogic Sdn. Bhd.</span></h3>
		<h4 style="color:white;">April 2021 - April 2023 (Senior Front-End Lead)</span></h4>
            <p><span class = "textFont">ProLogic Sdn. Bhd. is a multipurpose company, though the division that I had been assigned to was WebBased slotmaking. I was assigned to creating slot games in a short span of development time,
                around 1 month at the start to create a game. This was created primarily on Cocos2D, a multipurpose development tool. While there, I was tasked with maintaining and updating the skeleton for creating the slot games,
                creating slot games itself, maintaining communication between people of different fields while in the company, hitting slotgame sale milestones and many more.
                <br><br>
                The skills learned from working in the company is TypeScript, JavaScript, Socket, Aspx, .bat files, and much more.
